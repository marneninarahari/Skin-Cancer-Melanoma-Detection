# Skin-Cancer (Melanoma) Detection
## Project Overview:

•	The goal is to detect skin-cancer (Melanoma) using Deep Neural Network and design a webapp to deploy the model.

•	The ISIC2020 challenge dataset is used for this project.

•	Data augmentation and hyper-parameter tuning was performed. The VGG19 pre-trained model was used to develop the model and its performance was evaluated on the unseen test data.

•	Grad-CAM method is used to generate heatmaps to visualize the important regions in the images.

•	Developed webapp using FastAPI and deployed using Docker in AWS. The webapp link is given as follows:
